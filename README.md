# DS-Lab

This repository contains **Data Structures Lab assignments** implemented in **C++**.  
It covers fundamental data structures and algorithms with simple, clean, and well-commented code.

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered
- Arrays (inversions, distinct elements, matrix operations)
- Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
- Stacks & Queues (array and pointer-based, postfix evaluation)
- Trees (binary tree, BST, traversals)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, adjacency representation)
- Sparse Matrices (triplet form, addition, transpose, multiplication)
- Sorting & Searching (merge sort, quick sort, linear/binary search)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vanshnanda08/DS-Lab.git
cd DS-Lab
g++ Assignment-2/Q6.cpp -o program
./program
