// You have an array A of integers of size N, an array B (initially empty) and a stack S (initially
// empty). You are allowed to do the following operations:
// a) Take the first element of array A and push it into S and remove it from A.
// b) Take the top element from stack S, append it to the end of array B and remove it from S.
// You have to tell if it possible to move all the elements of array A to array B using the above
// operations such that finally the array B is sorted in ascending order.
