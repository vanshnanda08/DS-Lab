// Given an array arr[ ] of integers, the task is to find the Next Greater Element for each element of the
// array in order of their appearance in the array. Note: The Next Greater Element for an element x is
// the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element
// exist, consider the next greater element as -1.
